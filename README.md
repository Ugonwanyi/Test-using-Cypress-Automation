Hi, my name is Ugo Okechukwu. Welcome to my Portfolio.
This repository showcases my skills in software testing and test automation using Cypress. 

This showcases how i used Cypress for Signup & Login Test Automation for the Demoblaze website
It uses Cypress as the automation framework and Cucumber for Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) to write readable and maintainable test scenarios.

TECH STACK
* Cypress – JavaScript end-to-end testing framework
* Cucumber – For writing Gherkin-style feature files (BDD)
* Node.js – Runtime environment
* VS Code – Code editor

FEATURES COVERED
* Signup Page: Automates the process of signing up a new user on Demoblaze 
* Login (Username & Password): Verifies that existing users can log in successfully and checking happy path and edge cases




Test Script Creation Process
1. Test Scenarios in Gherkin:
Created feature files in plain English using the Given-When-Then format for both Signup and Login flows.
2. Step Definitions in Cypress:
Mapped each Gherkin step to Cypress test commands using custom step definition files.
3. Page Object Model
Used CSS selectors to interact with UI and elements
4. Included waits and assertions to ensure reliable test runs

TOOLS
* Cypress for Test Automation
* Cucumber Framework for BDD
* Jira for bug identification, monitoring and tracking
* GitHub for version control
* GitHub Actions for CI/CD
